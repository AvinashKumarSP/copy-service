To design an architecture that maps a source feed to a particular domain based on your reference data glossary and assigns a unique ID from the reference data glossary to the source feed, you can follow these steps:

1. Define Requirements and Inputs
   Source Feed: Data input which needs to be mapped.
   Reference Data Glossary (RDG): A database containing domain-specific data along with unique IDs.
2. High-Level Architecture
   The architecture consists of the following components:

Data Ingestion Layer: For collecting and preprocessing the source feed.
Data Processing Layer: For processing the source data and performing the mapping.
Mapping Engine: The core logic that maps the source feed to the RDG.
Storage Layer: For storing the mapped data with unique IDs.
Monitoring and Logging: For tracking the process and logging any issues.
3. Detailed Architecture
   3.1 Data Ingestion Layer

Source Connectors: Collect data from various sources (APIs, flat files, databases).
Preprocessing: Clean and normalize the data to ensure it matches the expected format.
3.2 Data Processing Layer

ETL Pipeline: Extract, Transform, Load pipeline to handle the data processing.
Extraction: Extract data from the source feed.
Transformation: Convert the extracted data into a format suitable for mapping.
Loading: Load the processed data into the mapping engine.
3.3 Mapping Engine

Reference Data Loader: Load reference data from the RDG into memory.
Mapping Logic:
Matching Algorithm: Implement a matching algorithm (e.g., fuzzy matching, exact matching) to map source feed data to the reference data.
Unique ID Assignment: Assign the unique ID from the RDG to the source feed data.
Rules Engine: Define rules for mapping based on the business logic (e.g., priority rules, fallback mechanisms).
3.4 Storage Layer

Database: Store the mapped data along with unique IDs. A relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) or a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB) can be used depending on the volume and structure of the data.
Data Warehouse: For historical data analysis and reporting.
3.5 Monitoring and Logging

Monitoring Tools: Tools like Prometheus, Grafana to monitor the data pipeline.
Logging: Centralized logging using tools like ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) to log errors, processing time, and other metrics.
4. Implementation Steps
   Step 1: Ingest Source Feed

Implement connectors to ingest data from various sources.
Preprocess the data to handle missing values, format inconsistencies, etc.
Step 2: Load Reference Data

Periodically load the reference data from RDG into the in-memory database for fast access.
Step 3: Map Source Feed to Reference Data

Apply the mapping logic to compare source feed data with reference data.
Use a matching algorithm to find the best match in the RDG.
Assign the unique ID from the matched reference data to the source feed data.
Step 4: Store Mapped Data

Store the mapped data along with unique IDs in a database.
Ensure the storage system supports quick retrieval and is scalable.
Step 5: Monitor and Log

Set up monitoring to track the performance and health of the data pipeline.
Log all the operations to detect and debug issues quickly.
5. Example Technologies
   Data Ingestion: Apache Kafka, Apache NiFi, Talend
   Data Processing: Apache Spark, Apache Flink, AWS Glue
   Mapping Engine: Custom application using Python, Java, or Scala
   Database: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Cassandra
   Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana
   Logging: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Splunk
6. Example Data Flow
   Source data is ingested and preprocessed.
   Reference data is loaded into memory from the RDG.
   Source data is processed through the mapping engine.
   The mapping engine uses the reference data to find matches and assign unique IDs.
   Mapped data is stored in the database.
   Monitoring and logging systems track the pipeline's performance and issues.
   This architecture ensures that your source feed is accurately mapped to your reference data glossary and each data entry is assigned a unique ID, facilitating data consistency and integrity.
